# React.js Workshop

This is the code and practical companion to my React.js + Typescript workshop.

Since this is based on a rolling exercise (creating a web-based incident management), each exercise will be stored in its own directory.

#### Assumptions:

 - Development on windows machine (windows 7 SP1 or above)
 - The exercises assume the following versions of tools (will be installed as part of exercises)
     - Node.js 6.10.3
     - Typescript 2.3 or above
     - Webpack 2 and above
     - React 15.5 and above
- Basic knowledge in HTML / CSS / JavaScript

## Day 1
### Exercise 1: Building the environment
In this exercise we create a working development environment - that will serve us for the rest of the workshop.
We will:
- Install Node.js
- Initialize project and install required dependencies
- Create and set all the required configuration files
- Create an empty web application
- Use automated tools to build and serve our web application

### Exercise 2: Hello World
By Low and Custom, our first foray into a new framework / language must be an **Hello World** application.
We will create our first react component that will do exactly this and provide the root of our future application.
